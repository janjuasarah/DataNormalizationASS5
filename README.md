ASSIGNMENT 5- DATA NORMALIZATION


Data Normalization:


Data Normalization is a process of organizing database attributes in columns and rows to cluster similar behavior. Most times it is used to gather purchase history to sell further. Other times it may be to gather demographics of their purchasers so the company knows who to appeal to. Your name is the most diverse attribute in this system, but everything else is gathered so that the company may access information in the fastest way possible. An example of this is Amazon’s “Customers who bought/viewed this also bought/viewed ….”
